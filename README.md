To test our webpage in a local server, users could follow the similar setup steps as those achieved in lab excercises:
1) open a terminal that could run python (e.g., anaconda)
2) go into the project folder that contains the "index.html" file.
3) run the commend "python -m http.server 8080" and open the corresponding webpage address within any broswers
- recommend to test our webpage using chrome

### Brief Code Explanation
Besides "index.html" and related images for the webpage background, we organized our data visualization codes (e.g., dataset and javascript files) into corresponding folders (e.g., item, network, hero, etc.). There is one .css file named as "style.css" to describe all of our web designs.
