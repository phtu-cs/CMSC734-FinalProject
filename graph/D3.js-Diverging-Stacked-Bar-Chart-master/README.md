Diverging Stacked Bar Chart
===========================

We create a diverging stacked bar chart to plot a 5 point Likert scale. There a lots of ways to
plot a Likert scale but according to [Robbins & Heiberger](https://www.amstat.org/sections/SRMS/Proceedings/y2011/Files/300784_64164.pdf), a diverging stacked bar chart is the best and I agree.

I've used [D3.js](http://d3js.org). There is also an [R package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HH/index.html) by Robbins & Heiberger.

The result of can be seen [here](https://wpoely86.github.io/D3.js-Diverging-Stacked-Bar-Chart/). I also render the svg to a canvas element using [canvg](https://github.com/gabelerner/canvg). [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) is used to have a 'Save as' function.
